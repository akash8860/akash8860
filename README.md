- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m akash sharma
My journey as a Machine Learning Intern at BSES Delhi has been an exciting fusion of AI, SQL, and data analysis, where I'm creating an AI-based sentiment analysis model that translates customer feedback into actionable insights. This role not only leverages but also expands my technical expertise acquired during my ongoing Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence at Amity University.

Previously, as an Application Support Specialist at BirchStreet Systems, my proficiency in SQL and Python for API was crucial in providing exemplary support and ensuring workflow functionality. Our team's collaborative efforts led to streamlined processes and maintained SLAs, reflecting my dedication to efficiency and client satisfaction
